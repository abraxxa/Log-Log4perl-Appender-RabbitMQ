SYNOPSIS
        use Log::Log4perl;

        my $log4perl_config = q{
            log4perl.logger = DEBUG, RabbitMQ

            log4perl.appender.RabbitMQ             = Log::Log4perl::Appender::RabbitMQ
            log4perl.appender.RabbitMQ.exchange    = myexchange
            log4perl.appender.RabbitMQ.routing_key = mykey
            log4perl.appender.RabbitMQ.layout      = Log::Log4perl::Layout::PatternLayout
        };

        Log::Log4perl::init(\$log4perl_config);

DESCRIPTION
    This is a Log::Log4perl appender for publishing log messages to RabbitMQ
    group using Net::RabbitMQ. Defaults for unspecified options are provided
    by Net::RabbitMQ and can be found in it's documentation.

  OPTIONS
    All of the following options can be passed to the constructor, or be
    specified in the Log4perl config file. Unless otherwise stated, any
    options not specified will get whatever defaults Net::RabbitMQ provides.
    See the documentation for that module for more details.

   Connection Options
    These options are used in the call to Net::RabbitMQ::connect() when the
    appender is created.

    user
    password
    host
        Defaults to localhost.

    port
    vhost
    channel_max
    frame_max
    heartbeat

   Exchange Options
    Except for declare_exchange, these options are used in a call to
    Net::RabbitMQ::exchange_declare() to declare the exchange specified on
    the exchange option (See "Publish Options"). If declare_exchange is
    false (the default) the exchange will not be declared and must already
    exist.

    declare_exchange
        Declare the exchange, or just trust that it already exists? Boolean,
        defaults to 0.

    exchange_type
        'direct, 'topic', etc. Boolean, defaults to 0.

    durable_exchange
        Should the exchange survive a restart? Boolean, defaults to 0.

    auto_delete_exchange
        Delete the exchange when this proccess disconnects? Boolean,
        defaults to 1.

   Publish Options
    These options are used in the call to Net::RabbitMQ::publish() for each
    message.

    routing_key
        The routing key for messages. If the routing key contains a %c or a
        %p it will be interpolated for each message. %c will be replaced
        with the Log4perl category. %p will be replaces with the Log4perl
        priority.

        Defaults to %C

    exchange
        The exchange to publish the message too. This exchange must already
        exist.

    mandatory
        boolean. Flag published messages mandatory.

    immediate
        boolean. Flag published messages immediate.
